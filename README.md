# What is this?

This is a game I made in 72 hours for Mini Jam 169.  
It is also the first game I made for itch.io.

The Unlicense applies to all source code except for the fonts and sound effects.  
However, those are under the public domain, too.  

I'm going to figure out how to split off while maintaining the git history.  
I heard you `clone` it.

# How to run 
1. Download the .zip file
2. Unzip the .zip file
3. Load up Godot
4. Find the `project.godot` file 
5. Click on "Import & Edit"
6. Ignore all the editor errors, if there are no errors at run time, it works.
7. Click the Play Button that says "Run Project"

# What's with the "other_copyrights"?

`GODOT_ENGINE.txt` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY.txt` are there to fulfill any licenses they come with.  
These are not important to the source code itself.  

# What about those 2 fonts?
Both of those are in the public domain, made by GGBotNet.  
Here are the sources:

# It doesn't work.
1. If you are on safari, check to see if Lockdown mode is off.
2. If you are on firefox, see if WebGL is on.  
Otherwise, comment the error on itch.io.

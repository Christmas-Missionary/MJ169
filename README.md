# What is this?

This is a game I made in 72 hours for Mini Jam 169.  
It is also the first game I made for itch.io.

The 0BSD license applies to all source code except for the fonts and sound effects.  
However, those are under the public domain, too.  

# This is archived, why?

I'd like for the submission and its source code to be exactly as is.  
If you want to see or use the source code to an updated version, go [here](https://github.com/Christmas-Missionary/The-Last-Hexagon).

# How to run 
1. Download the .zip file
2. Unzip the .zip file
3. Load up Godot
4. Find the `project.godot` file 
5. Click on "Import & Edit"
6. Ignore all the editor errors, if there are no errors at run time, it works.
7. Click the Play Button that says "Run Project"

# What's with the "other_copyrights"?

`GODOT_ENGINE.txt` and `GODOT_3RD_PARTY.txt` are there to fulfill any licenses they come with.  
These are not important to the source code itself.  

# What about those 2 fonts?
Both of those are in the public domain, made by GGBotNet.  
Here are the sources:  
https://www.fontspace.com/unitblock-font-f104834  
https://www.fontspace.com/home-video-font-f116641  

# It doesn't work.
This is to be expected when I only have 3 days to make a game.   
A few things to note:  
1. If you are on safari, check to see if Lockdown mode is off.  
2. If you are on firefox, see if WebGL is on.  

See if this bug persists in the updated version.  
Otherwise, report an issue there.
